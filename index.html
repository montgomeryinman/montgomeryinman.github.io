	<h1> Hey, I am Montgomery! </h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website! I am a senior at Iowa State University majoring in Data Science. I have always been interested in transforming raw numbers into insightful and meaningful stories!  </p> 

	<p>Feel free to take a look around at my past data viz work, my resume, and the very cool tab labeled Fun Fact!</p>

	<p> Here is a grainy, fairly funny picture of me on my favorite place in the world's (Hilton Coliseum) jumbotron.

	<p>Disclaimer: I have coded this website with my very little knowledge of HTML5 and CSS so I apologive if something is wrong or looks ugly. I will try to make it better.</p>
