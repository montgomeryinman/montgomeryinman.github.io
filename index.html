	<h1> Hey, I am Montgomery! </h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website! I am a senior at Iowa State University majoring in Data Science. I have always been interested in transforming raw numbers into insightful and meaningful stories!</p> 

	<p>I am a huge sports fan, so I like to apply my Data Science knowledge to sports, especially basketball. I am a lover of Iowa State sports and these Chicago sports teams (even though it hurts sometimes): </p>

	<p>Feel free to take a look around at my past data viz work, my resume, and the very cool tab labeled Super Fun Fact!</p>

	<p> Here is a grainy, fairly funny picture of me on my favorite place in the world's (Hilton Coliseum) jumbotron.

	<p>Disclaimer: I have coded this website with my very little knowledge of HTML5 and CSS so I apologize if something is wrong or looks ugly. I will try to make it better.</p>
